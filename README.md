The goal with this project was to recreate one I did in my Orbital Mechanics 2 course. The project objective is to use NASA JPL ephemeris data to create a realistic preliminary mission design to take a spacecraft from Earth to Mars. We used MATLAB for this assignment, so my objective here was to redo it entirely in Python.
